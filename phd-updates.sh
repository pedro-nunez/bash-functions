      # The following are some more detailed explanations from the nice command, gotten among other places from https://stackoverflow.com/a/37911473/4405516
      # 
      # First the s/.*{weeks/week[^\n]*/&\n\\\setcounter{section}{'"${PREVIOUS_WEEK_NUMBER}"'}/' part
      # This is sed's substitute command
      # In principle, this command alone would treat each line independently and by itself
      # This behaviour is modified with the previous part '1h;1!H;$!d;x; which we will explain later
      # But let us focus on the substitute command first
      # .*{weeks/week[^\n]* is the pattern that we are searching for
      # . is any single character
      # * is repetition of the previous character zero or more times
      # Hence .* searches for any possible pattern of any possible length
      # And .*{weeks/week searches for any possible patter of any possible length finishing with {weeks/week
      # [^\n] matches any character other than \n
      # Therefore .*{weeks/week[^\n]* matches any string of characters finishing with {weeks/week and then goes on to match up until the end of that line
      # The reason to use [^\n]* instead of .*$ is that later on, when dealing with multiple lines together, we would also match {weeks/week.*\nThe next line\nAnd the next one\nAnd so on until the end of any line after the line containing {weeks/week; due to sed's greed, this would end up matching up until the end of the pattern space I think
      # &\n\\\setcounter{section}{'"${PREVIOUS_WEEK_NUMBER}"'} is the string which we will use to replace the match
      # The & character represents the match, so we will append a new line with \setcounter... to the match
      #
      # Now we move on to 1h;1!H;$!d;x; the following explanation is based on the answer given in https://stackoverflow.com/a/12834372/4405516 and the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0mKlIswojA
      # Right after we call sed, the first line of main.tex is read and inserted automatically into the pattern space
      # Then the command 1h is executed, which copies the first line of main.tex into the hold space
      # Then the second command would be executed, but this command is executed on every line except on the first line of main.tex, so it is not executed now
      # Then the third command $!d is executed, because we are not yet in the last line of main.tex
      # This command deletes the current (first line) from the pattern space and moves on to a new line, in this case the second line of main.tex, skipping all the remaining commands that would have affected to the line that we just deleted from the pattern space
      # The second line is loaded into the pattern space and the hold space is unchanged, still containing the first line of main.tex
      # Now we start editing the second line of main.tex, currently in the pattern space, with the same array of commands
      # Now the command 1h is not executed anymore because we are already on the second line
      # On the other hand the command 1!H is executed, appending the current pattern space to the hold buffer
      # The hold buffer contains now the first two lines of main.tex
      # If we are not in the last line of main.tex yet, then the third command $!d is executed, and the process starts again from the third line of main.tex
      # Eventually we get to the last line of main.tex and we append it to the hold space with 1!H
      # But this time $!d does not trigger, because we are currenlty on the last line
      # The next command, x, exchanges now the hold buffer and the pattern buffer
      # So the current pattern buffer contains the hole file main.tex (in a single line with \n instead of line breaks, I think)
      # The current hold space contains only the last line, but we don't care about that anymore
      # Now the substitute command is applied to the current pattern buffer, containing all of main.tex (on a single line with \n instead of line breaks, I think)
      # The regular expressions used in the search pattern yield now the desired result: add a line \setcounter... right after the last line containing the pattern {weeks/week
      #
      # Add \include{weeks/week${WEEK_NUMBER}} after \setcounter{section}{${PREVIOUS_WEEK_NUMBER}}
